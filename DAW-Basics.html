<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I'd honestly say to stay away from these for the most part if you're unfamiliar with them.</p>
<br>
<p>There is one I would recommend to starters, but that in of itself would need a recommendation to read up on theory from places like <a href="https://www.musictheory.net" target="_blank">musictheory.net</a>.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="https://musescore.org/en" target="_blank">Musescore</a> isn't a Digital Audio Workstation in the strictest sense, but as a composition tool it has the best compromise between quality and ease of use for learning.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>There's no amount of text I could put here to get you prepared for Musescore, so the next best thing I could do would be linking you to their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTYuWi2LmaPECOZrC6bkPHBkYY9_WEexT" target="_blank">youtube tutorials</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>The midi libraries and samples do sound great, though. For comparison's sake, here's a version of Ruined Oaths put through Musescore:</p>
<audio controls muted loop class="audio-track" style="filter:invert(1);">
        <source src="music\RO - Formats\Professional\Ruined Oath - MuseTuned.wav" type="audio/wav">
        <source src="music\RO - Formats\Professional\Ruined Oath - MuseTuned.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
