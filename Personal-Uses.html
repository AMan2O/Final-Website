<h1 class="line">"So what do <i>I</i> do with this stuff?"</h1>
<br>
<p>Really, it boils down to a couple things:</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">1. I like the sound, honestly</h3>
<br>
<p>Simply put, a lot of combinations and mixes I like only existed in my head for the longest time.</p>
<br>
<p>Once I got it in my head to actually do something with them, I found that I generally end up making a lot of loops or background themes. The informal categories were quite handy for that back then.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Handy idle audio</h3>
<br>
<p>As a DM for a tabletop group, I've found a surprising amount of use from having instruments on standby. With enough elbow grease and description, you can sell any random sound as anything.</p>
<br>
<p>Combined with free tools like <a href="https://www.dungeonscrawl.com">Dungeon Scrawl</a> (a mapping tool), both tools have added a lot of depth..</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Couple those reasons with the nascent hope that I could more serious with piano, and it's been a lot of fun self learning. Even if it is tooth grinding at times, haha.</p>
