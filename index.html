<p>If anybody here would like some unsolicited anecdotal advice about how to start with music design, you've come to the right spot!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="ital">"...Why should I listen?"</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Should you ask this fair question, Here's some potential considerations:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>You get melodies or progressions stuck in your head constantly</li>
  <li>Need a quick and dirty solution for a backing track</li>
  <li>You want to try making music but are unsure of where to start</li>
  <li>You're just looking for a 5 minute or so distraction</li>
  <li>You profoundly don't care either way</li>
</ul>
<br>
<form style="text-align: left;" id="motivation">
<label for="choice">Which reason best applies to you?</label>
<select id="choice" name="choice" required>
  <option hidden disabled selected value="angle">What's your angle?</option>
  <option value="stuck">Stuck Melodies</option>
  <option value="qd">Quick & Dirty</option>

</form>
<br>
<p id="response"></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="ital" id="Where">"Where do I start?"</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>You have two main options: Do what I did and just start messing around, or Study up first.</p>
<br>



<p>In my experience, I'd categorize the options I saw into three main types:</p>
<br>
<table>

  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="line">The Informal</td>
    <td class="line">The Trackers</td>
    <td class="line">The Professional</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Examples include:</td>
    <td>Chrome Music Lab, Beepbox</td>
    <td>Furnace, OpenMPT</td>
    <td>Reaper, FL Studio</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="Informal">The Informal</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This category is great for dipping your toes into the space.</p>
<br>
<p>The general vibe of these types are an emphasis on making <i>something</i> to listen to, and they're great for getting ideas out quick.</p>
<br>
<a href="Beep-Basics.html" target="_blank">
<img src="Icons\Beepbox.png" alt="A circular logo of the browser-based composition tool 'Beepbox'." style="max-width: 75%;">
</a>
<br>
<p>(If you want some more specific suggestions, click the logo)</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tool, <a href="https://www.beepbox.co" target="_blank">Beepbox.co</a> and its many forks (my personal favorite being <a href="https://jummb.us" target="_blank">jummb.us</a>) are great as you get better and improve.</p>
<br>
<p>They start out more involved than things such as Chrome Music Lab's <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/" target="_blank">Song Maker</a>, but you can explore the Song Settings and Preference tabs at your own pace as you get more comfortable.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you're looking for something more specific however, the next choice could be:</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="Tracker">The Trackers</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This category is great for chiptune and repetition.</p>
<br>
<p>They can be more accurately described as sound emulators, and are <i> far</i> more particular as a result.</p>
<br>
<a href="Furnace-Basics.html" target="_blank">
<img src="Icons\Furnace.png" alt="A bowl containing several computer chips, the logo for the chiptune tracker 'Furnace'." style="max-width: 75%;">
</a>
<br>
<p>There's a very real chance that without reading up on a specific tool's documentation (like <a href="https://tildearrow.org/furnace/" target="_blank">Furnace's</a>), you'd have no clue what's even on screen (I know I didn't!).</p>
<br>
<p>A fun quirk of many trackers is that because of their emulation, many of them are capable of natively running on hardware like an NES or retro computers!</p>
<br>
<p>If it is what you're looking for, they're still conceptually simple once you learn the specifics.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The same cannot be said about the last category, however.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="professional">The Professional</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>These are what separates the hobbyist from the audiophile.</p>
<br>
<p>These go beyond an abstracted structure, and are instead so free-form that I would recommend studying up music theory first before approaching them.</p>
<br>
<a href="DAW-Basics.html" target="_blank">
<img src="Icons\Reaper.png" alt="A multicolor icon, the logo for the Digital Audio Workstation 'Reaper'." style="max-width: 75%;">
</a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Powerful DAWs like <a href="https://www.image-line.com" target="_blank">FL Studio</a> are fully paid, and even the previous example <a href="https://www.reaper.fm" target="_blank">Reaper</a> politely asks after the trial period expires.</p>
<br>
<p>With that said however, nothing compares to the mixing and quality control options a good DAW can provide. If you can stick with it, it is unmatched.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="now" class="ital">"...What now?"</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Having given my thoughts about good options, now all I can recommend is application.</p>
<br>
<p>Given that you said you felt you </p><p id="callback"></p><p>I'd say you should move forward with that.</p>
<br>
<p>If you really feel like it, you can try looking at my <a href="Personal-Uses.html" target="_blank">own use cases</a> to get some ideas, but frankly you can do what you want.</p>
